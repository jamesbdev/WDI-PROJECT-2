# WDI-PROJECT-2
my second WDI project 


The idea for the project was to create a google maps application for finding Korean restaurants in central London. 

the ideas were to locate the restaurants and find a pathway and calculate how long it would take to go.

also the app needed a way to authenticate the user

I started writing down ideas on paper and writing the different pieces I would need.

I created a simple wireframe in Balsamiq and creating lists in Trello.

example of wireframing:
