# WDI-PROJECT-2
my second WDI project 


The idea for the project was to create a google maps application for finding Korean restaurants in central London. 

the ideas were to locate the restaurants and find a pathway and calculate how long it would take to go.

also the app needed a way to authenticate the user

I started writing down ideas on paper and writing the different pieces I would need.

I created a simple wireframe in Balsamiq and creating lists in Trello.

example of wireframing:

I did some research about the Google Places API and created a user key.

Then I started writing code to set up the API starting with the index.js page. 

Day 2 - Today wrote the config routes files, the controllers and models. (with help from Johnnie) 

getting error: unexpected identifier
challenges: don't fully understand user model 

Day 3 

- corrected some mistakes with Alfredo and started writing the index.js file. stuck on typo. 
- stuck on latlng not defined
