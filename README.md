# WDI-PROJECT-2
my second WDI project

===================
Objectives: 
-----
The idea for the project was to create a google maps application for finding Korean restaurants in central London. The app also needed a way to authenticate the user

 
 
Method 
------

I started writing down ideas on paper and writing the different pieces I would need, such as the data for the restaurants, brainstorming ideas for functionality, looking at different fonts in google fonts. I also had a look at snazzymaps.com to get an idea for my app.

I created a simple wireframe in Balsamiq and created some lists in Trello for my objectives.

example of wireframing:

I did some research about the Google Places API and created a user key.

Then I started writing code to set up the API starting with the index.js page.

Day 2 - Today wrote the config routes files, the controllers and models. (with help from Johnnie)

getting error: unexpected identifier
challenges: don't fully understand user model

Day 3

- corrected some mistakes with Alfredo and started writing the index.js file. stuck on typo.
- stuck on latlng not defined

Day 4

stuck on a 404 error for one of my controller files restaurants

Day5
corrected bugs
completed the MPV(adding database for restaurants and showing the map) + styling

Day 6

started styling the app, tried to change the icons but the picture isn't loading


Additions:

- once the user chooses a restaurant, find a pathway and calculate how long it would take to go.

- ratings in info view
- telephone number

1) personal challenges 
 connecting everything together (express, authentication,google maps, routes ...) 
 
 solving issues and getting stuck 
 things I wanted to improve: overall knowledge of express, authentication, bootstrap(review) 
 
 2) wins 

 wins - putting in the time, completed my objectives, got better at planning and problem solving - breaking down tackling one problem at a time

3) to do in the future 

 adding more features, becoming more confident using javascript
